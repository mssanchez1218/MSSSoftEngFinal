  <h1>Choosing Your Parts</h1>
  <p>There are many things that go into picking the parts for your PC build with the most obvious two being: 1. budget and 2. what you want to use the 
  PC for.<br></p>
  <p>Budget is one of the most controllable variables in your quest to build a PC, whether you want to build a $300 desktop just for coding and 
  using streaming service and such or if you want to build a $1500 gaming computer to play games in 4K and such.<br>While budget is controllable, it also controls the parts that you are able to pick, if you have a $300 budget, you can't expect to have a machine that runs 3D animating software or video rendering.<br></p>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>The main tool that I and many others recommend is using <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PC PartPicker</a>. This website was made for those who 
  want to build PC's and see their available options for pricing and also even shows compatibility of parts to you. For beginning builders this website is the best thing to use becuase you won't have to worry about socket types, physical dimensions and if parts work together, the website takes care of that all for you.<br></p>
  <p>For most PC's you only need about 8 parts: </p>
  <ul>
  	<li>CPU: the brains of the computer</li>
    <li>CPU Cooler: these are sometimes included with your CPU when you purchase it.</li>
    <li>Motherboard: what controls the rest of your components</li>
    <li>RAM: system memory</li>
    <li>Storage: where you install your OS and keep files, some systems have multiple devices.</li>
    <li>Video Card: needed if CPU doesnt support onboard graphics, or if system is for gaming, rendering or animating, any graphical heavy stuff.</li>
    <li>PSU: Power!!!</li>
    <li>Case: Where you install components</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Here is some video reference for picking parts (not relevant for all builds, just an example)</h3>
